# iridium-swift

This is a Swift port of [Iridium](https://gitlab.com/subnetzero/iridium/tree/master), a simple register-based VM. The original and canonical version of Iridium is written in Rust by [Fletcher Haynes](https://blog.subnetzero.io) and is still under active development. Fletcher has written a [number of tutorials](https://blog.subnetzero.io/project/iridium-vm/) documenting the development of the VM.
